This blog is a collection of articles, examples and release notes about the library [runpandas](https://github.com/corriporai/runpandas).

My name is [Marcel Caraciolo](https://github.com/marcelcaraciolo), the creator of the runpandas and when I am not running or coding, I am working as a bioinformatics coordinator at Genomika Einstein laboratory (a brazilian molecular genetics lab) and as laboratory systems product manager. I am also passioned about lego architecture sets and productivity reading.
