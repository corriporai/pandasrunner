My name is Marcel Caraciolo, creator of **[runpandas](https://github.com/corriporai/runpandas)**. When I am not running or coding, I manage the bioinformatics team at the Genomika Einstein, a  genetics molecular laboratory, and product manager for some laboratory management systems. Amateur runner, lover of Lego Architecture sets and passioned about productivity and agile techniques.
